### Usage
Simply use this image name pattern in any of your projects:
```sh
serversideup/php:{{version}}-{{variation-name}}
```
For example... If I wanted to run **PHP 8.0** with **FPM + NGINX**, I would use this image:
```sh
serversideup/php:8.0-fpm-nginx
```

### Real-life working example
You can see a bigger picture on how these images are used from Development to Production by viewing this video that shows a high level overview how we deploy "[ROAST](https://roastandbrew.coffee/)" which is a demo production app for [our book](https://serversideup.net/ultimate-guide-to-building-apis-and-spas-with-laravel-and-vuejs/).

### Updates

# Why these images and not other ones?
These images have a few key differences. These images are:

## üöÄ These images are used in production
Our philosophy is: **What you run in production is what you should be running in development.**

You'd be shocked how many people create a Docker image and use it in the local development only. These images are designed with the intention of being deployed to the open and wild Internet.

## üßê Based off of [S6 Overlay](https://github.com/just-containers/s6-overlay)
S6 Overlay is very helpful in managing a container's lifecycle that has multiple processes.

**Wait... Isn't Docker supposed to be a "single process per container"?** Yes, that's what it's like in a perfect world. Unfortunately PHP isn't like that. You need both a web server and a PHP-FPM server to see your files in order for your application to load.

We follow the [S6 Overlay Philosophy](https://github.com/just-containers/s6-overlay#the-docker-way) on how we can still get a single, disposable, and repeatable image of our application out to our servers.

# Documentation
We have everything fully documented and available on our website. If you find an issue, everything is located under the `/docs` folder or the `/docs/content` folder if you're looking to submit a change to the documentation.

# Submitting issues and pull requests
Since there are a lot of dependencies on these images, please understand that it can make it complicated on merging your pull request.

We'd love to have your help, but it might be best to explain your intentions first before contributing.
