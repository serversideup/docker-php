# Upgrading
There are two methods for choosing how you'd like to manage upgrades.

1. Automatic updates
1. Locking into a release

Before we dive into these two options, let's talk about the release process.

## Release process
All source code is merged into the `main` branch, which automatically build our "beta" images.

After testing the images internally and from other community members, we will [publish a release on GitHub](https://github.com/serversideup/docker-php/releases) with a detailed changelog.

## Automatic Updates
If you choose an image following our guide on [how images are tagged](/docs/getting-started/installation#how-images-are-tagged), then these images will receive automatic updates.

::code-panel
---
label: This tag format will receive automatic updates
---
```bash
serversideup/php:{{php-version}}-{{variation-name}}
```
::

Every Tuesday at 0800 UTC our images will rebuild giving you the latest dependency updates.

This is great for automated security, but if you're making a lot of customizations we *do not* recommend you using automated updates.

Instead, you may want to consider locking into a tagged version.

## Locking into a release
If you're making a lot of customizations or have a disciplined dependency management process, it is advised that you lock into a version and upgrade following your own change process.

To do this, you just need to add the version number at the end.

::code-panel
---
label: This will lock your version
---
```bash
serversideup/php:{{php-version}}-{{variation-name}}-v{{version-number}}
```
::

**These images are built once and will never receive any automatic updates.**

::code-panel
---
label: For example... this would lock into our `v2.1.0` release
---
```bash
serversideup/php:8.2-fpm-apache-v2.1.0
```
::

You can take care of the dependency updates on your own and upgrade under your own discretion.

## Updating the Docker images on your own
You and simply run `apt-get update && apt-get upgrade` within your own image
::code-panel
---
label: Example Dockerfile with manual updates
---
```Dockerfile
FROM serversideup/php:8.2-fpm-nginx-v2.1.0

RUN apt-get update \
    && apt-get upgrade -y \
    && apt-get clean \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* /tmp/* /var/tmp/* /usr/share/doc/*
```
::

You would just add this to the top of your custom Dockerfile and it would install all package updates for you on demand.

## Subscribe to repository updates
Regardless if you are choosing to use automatic updates or manual updates, it is highly advised to subscribe to our releases. You can do this through the "Watch" button on our [GitHub](https://github.com/serversideup/docker-php).
