# Where do you host your stuff?
We get this question often. Our biggest principle is: **your infrastructure should be able to run anywhere.**

We run all of our production servers on the latest LTS release of Ubuntu Server. The hosts we use are below. Some may be affiliate links that kick a few bucks at no extra cost to you, but they do not affect our recommendations at all. 

### [Vultr](https://vultr.grsm.io/create)
**Our current favorite.** Excellent performance and value. Lots of datacenter options too.

### [Digital Ocean](https://m.do.co/c/f3bad4b927ca)
Lots of developer love here. Not the best performing servers, but they do have a lot of awesome products!

## Can I run this on another host?
Sure! It all depends what platform you want to use, but if it supports Docker images, you likely can run it. These images are designed to give you freedom no matter where you want to run them.
