# About this project
We're taking the extra effort to open source as much as we can. Not only could this potentially help someone learn a little bit of Docker, but it makes it a *heck of a lot* easier for us to work with you on new open source ideas.

## Project credits & inspiration

### [Chris Fidao](https://github.com/fideloper)
Majority of our knowledge came from Chris' course, [Shipping Docker](https://serversforhackers.com/shipping-docker). If you have yet to discover his content, you will be very satisfied with every course he has to offer. He's a great human being and excellent educator.

### [PHPDocker.io](https://github.com/phpdocker-io/base-images)
This team has an excellent repository and millions of pulls per month. We really like how they structured their code.

### [linuxserver.io](https://www.linuxserver.io/)
These guys are absolute aces when it comes to Docker development. They are a great resource for tons of open source Docker images.
