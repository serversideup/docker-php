## Variable-first Configuration
Our design philosophy is built all around simplicity. The process of customizing the behavior of PHP is as simple as setting an environment variable. We took every common configuration option and set it up so you can change these values in a simple method, defaulting every single option to production-ready values.

See our [environment variable specifications](/docs/reference/environment-variable-specification) for more information.

## Optimized for Laravel & WordPress
We did the hard work of customizing the official PHP image and giving you everything to get started with running PHP's most popular frameworks in seconds. We also hardened the images to help protect your PHP application from common attacks.

## Production-ready
We believe images should be ready for production and able to live in the open and wild Internet. We took our years of experience and tweaked these images to be performant and secure as possible. Having these values published online allows others to review, contribute, and improve the images -- giving you the best security and performance possible.

## What is "S6 Overlay?"
[S6 Overlay](https://github.com/just-containers/s6-overlay) is a process supervisor designed for containerization from the ground up. It's a modern alternative to [Supervisor (aka Supervisord)](https://supervisord.org/). We only use this in our `serversideup/php:*-fpm-apache` and `serversideup/php:*-fpm-nginx` images, as they require two processes to run a service.
