# Default Configurations
::lead-p
`serversideup/php` is configured for real-world deployments right out of the box. This saves you many hours so you can launch faster than ever.
::

## Production-ready and optimized for Laravel & WordPress
All values are defaulted to improve security and performance. We also spent the time to carefully review official documentation and include packages that are required specifically for Laravel and WordPress.

## Default Environment Variables
We allow the ability to customize the behavior of PHP with environment variables. Be sure to review our production-ready default values on our [environment variable specification](/docs/reference/environment-variable-specification) page.

## Default PHP Extensions
The following extensions are installed by default:

| **Extension** | **Description** | **Why we included it** |
|---------------|-----------------|------------------------|
| [mysqli](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.mysqli.php) | The "MySQL Improved" extension is an older extension for connecting to MySQL 4.1 and above. | **Enabled for fpm-apache only**. This is a legacy MySQL connector required for WordPress.|
| [pcntl](https://www.php.net/manual/en/intro.pcntl.php) | Process Control support in PHP implements the Unix style of process creation, program execution, signal handling and process termination. | This is required for [Laravel queues and Laravel Horizon](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/queues#timeout)|
| [pdo_mysql](https://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.pdo-mysql.php) | The MySQL PDO extension allows you to connect to MySQL databases. | MySQL and MariaDB databases are very popular. |
| [pdo_pgsql](https://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.pdo-pgsql.php) | The PostgreSQL PDO extension allows you to connect to PostgreSQL databases. | PostgreSQL databases are very popular. |
| [redis](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.redis.php) | The Redis extension allows you to connect to Redis databases. | Redis is very popular for caching and it's also required for [Laravel Horizon](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/horizon). Our tests concluded adding this package only added 2MB to the image size. |
| [zip](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.zip.php) | The Zip extension allows you to create and extract zip files. | We included this for the popularity of apps working with ZIP files. This package is also required if you're working with attachments on [Laravel Dusk](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/dusk#attaching-files). |

The official PHP images are already providing the following extensions:
- ctype
- curl
- dom
- fileinfo
- filter
- hash
- mbstirng
- openssl
- pcre
- session
- tokenizer
- xml

## Default Operating System Packages
The following packages are installed by default:

| **Package** | **Description** | **Image variations** | **Why we included it** |
|-------------|-----------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| `fcgi`<br/>(Debian)<br/>`libfcgi-bin`<br/>(Alpine) | FastCGI is a protocol for interfacing interactive programs with a web server. | *-fpm-nginx <br/> *-fpm-apache | This is required for the webserver to interface with PHP-FPM |
| `gettext` (Debian) <br/> `gettext-base` (Alpine) | GNU gettext is a framework for translating user interfaces. | *-fpm-nginx <br/> *-fpm-apache | This is required for the `envsubst` command. We use this command to process templates on container initialization. |
| `shadow` | Shadow is required for the `usermod` command. | *-alpine | This is required to change the UID and GID of the `www-data` user in `docker-php-serversideup-set-id`. |

## Default Entrypoint Scripts
We created an entrypoint script that scans the `entrypoint.d` directory for other shell scripts to execute before the main container process starts. All scripts are executed in alphabetical order so you can have full control over what script execution order.

We also provide a few default scripts to help you get started.

| **Script Name** | **Description** | **Image variations** |
|------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| `0-container-info.sh` | Shows basic execution information, such as Docker User, UID, GID, etc. | all |
| `1-debug-mode.sh` | Sets PHP to debug mode if `LOG_OUTPUT_LEVEL = "debug"` | all |
| `10-init-unit.sh` | Processes Unit templates, configures SSL (if enabled), and prepares NGINX Unit for launch | unit |
| `10-init-webserver-config.sh` | Processes web server configuration templates, configures SSL (if enabled), and prepares web server for launch | *-nginx <br/> *-apache |
| `50-laravel-automations.sh` | If `AUTORUN_ENABLED` is set to true, and a Laravel installation is detected, the following commands will automatically execute on container start: <br/> - `php artisan config:cache` <br/> - `php artisan route:cache` <br/> - `php artisan view:cache` <br/> - `php artisan event:cache` <br/> - `php artisan migrate --force --isolated` | all |

## Disabling Default Entrypoint Scripts
If you want full control to customize your image, all default entrypoint scripts can be disabled by setting `DISABLE_DEFAULT_CONFIG` to `true`.
