# Laravel Autorun Script
`serversideup/php` has a "Laravel Autorun" script that helps you automate certain steps during your deployments. By default, storage linking is the only automation enabled. You can disable the entire script by setting setting the `AUTORUN_ENABLED` variable. See our [variable reference document](/docs/reference/environment-variable-specification) for more details.

## Available Automations

::code-panel
---
label: Storage Linking
---
```bash
php artisan storage:link
```
::

**Storage linking is ENABLED by default.** You can disable this behavior by setting `AUTORUN_LARAVEL_STORAGE_LINK=false`.

::code-panel
---
label: Database Migrations
---
```bash
php artisan migrate --force --isolated
```
::

**Automatic migrations are DISABLED by default.** To enable, set an environment variable of `AUTORUN_LARAVEL_MIGRATION=true` on your container. This requires Laravel v9.38.0 or higher.
