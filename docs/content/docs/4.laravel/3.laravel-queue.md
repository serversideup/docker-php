# Laravel Queue with Docker
All you need to do is pass the Laravel Queue command to the container and S6 will automatically monitor it for you.

## Important concepts
1. It's usually best to run the queue as a separate container (but using the same image)
2. If you need to run the queue in the same container, you might want to look into extending the image with S6 Overlay and have S6 monitor the process for you
