# Laravel Horizon with Docker
We simply pass the command to the Docker container and let S6 Overlay monitor the process.

## Important concepts
1. In most cases, you probably want to run this as a separate container from your web container
1. If you want to run this in the same container, then you should create a custom S6 script to bring the service up and to monitor it
1. Ensure that you have your `.env` configured correctly to authenticate with Redis
1. Ensure Redis is running before you attempt to connect Horizon to Redis
