# Laravel Automations
`serversideup/php` has a "Laravel Automations" script that helps automate common tasks to maintain your Laravel application and improve it's performance. By default, the script is **DISABLED**. We only recommend enabling this script in production environments.

## What the script does

::note
In order for this script to run,`AUTORUN_ENABLED` must be set to `true`. Once the main part of the script is enabled, you can control the individual tasks by setting the corresponding environment variables to `true` or `false`. See our [variable reference document](/docs/reference/environment-variable-specification) for more details.
::

| Environment Variable | Laravel Command | Description |
| -------------------- | -------------- | ----------- |
| `AUTORUN_LARAVEL_STORAGE_LINK` | `php artisan storage:link` | Creates a symbolic link from `public/storage` to `storage/app/public`. |
| `AUTORUN_LARAVEL_MIGRATION` | `php artisan migrate` | Runs migrations. |
| `AUTORUN_LARAVEL_OPTIMIZE` | `php artisan optimize` | Optimizes the application. |
| `AUTORUN_LARAVEL_CONFIG_CACHE` | `php artisan config:cache` | Caches the configuration files into a single file. |
| `AUTORUN_LARAVEL_ROUTE_CACHE` | `php artisan route:cache` | Caches the routes. |
| `AUTORUN_LARAVEL_VIEW_CACHE` | `php artisan view:cache` | Caches the views. |
| `AUTORUN_LARAVEL_EVENT_CACHE` | `php artisan event:cache` | Creates a manifest of all your application's events and listeners. |

## php artisan storage:link
Creates a symbolic link from `public/storage` to `storage/app/public`.

## php artisan migrate
Before running migrations, we ensure the database is online and ready to accept connections. By default, we will wait 30 seconds before timing out.

You can enable the [`--isolated`](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/migrations#running-migrations) flag by setting `AUTORUN_LARAVEL_MIGRATION_ISOLATION` to `true`, which will ensure no other containers are running a migration.

**Special Notes for Isolated Migrations:**
- Requires Laravel v9.38.0+
- Your database must support database locks (meaning SQLite is not supported)

## php artisan optimize
Laravel comes with an artisan command called `optimize`, which will optimize the application by caching the configuration, routes, views, and events all in one command.

You can disable any cache features by setting the corresponding environment variable to `false` (for example, `AUTORUN_LARAVEL_CONFIG_CACHE` would disable configuration caching).

If your application is running Laravel v11.38.0 or higher, we will utilize the `optimize --except` parameter to exclude any cache features you have disabled. Otherwise, we will run the individual optimizations separately.

It's possible to disable the `optimize` command by setting `AUTORUN_LARAVEL_OPTIMIZE` to `false`, but the major advantage of using the `optimize` command is other dependencies may hook into this action and run other commands.

## php artisan config:cache
This command caches all configuration files into a single file, which can then be quickly loaded by Laravel. Once the configuration is cache, the `.env` file will no longer be loaded.

## php artisan route:cache
This command caches the routes, dramatically decrease the time it takes to register all of your application's routes. After running this command, your cached routes file will be loaded on every request.

## php artisan view:cache
This command caches all of the views in your application, which can greatly decrease the time it takes to render your views.

[Read more about view caching →](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/views#optimizing-views)

## php artisan event:cache
This command creates a manifest of all your application's events and listeners, which can greatly speed up the process of registering them with Laravel.

## Debugging the AUTORUN script
It's very important to understand the nature of how containerized environments work when debugging the AUTORUN script. In some cases, some users may become frustrated when they push an update but their changes are never deployed.

In most cases, this is due to a bug in their application code that causes a migration or some other process to fail.

::note
If a failure occurs in the Laravel Automations script, it will exit with a non-zero exit code -- preventing the container from starting.
::

If you are experiencing issues, you can enable the `AUTORUN_DEBUG` environment variable to get more detailed ouput of what could be going wrong.

If you need even more information, you can set `LOG_OUTPUT_LEVEL` to `debug` to get **A TON** of output of what's exactly happening.

### Preventing issues with the AUTORUN script
- Ensure you are running the latest version of `serversideup/php`
- Ensure you have dependencies installed before calling this script
- Use automated testing to catch issues before deploying
