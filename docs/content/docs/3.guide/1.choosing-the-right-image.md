# Choosing the right image
We offer many variations, so it can be overwhelming when choosing an image to use.

## Selecting a PHP Version
PHP is constantly evolving. Every release is making PHP faster and more secure. It's usually best to be on the latest version to take advantage of the security and performance features. [Check PHP's official "Supported Versions" site](https://www.php.net/supported-versions.php) to get the latest information.

Choosing the PHP version highly depends on your code's compatibility for the latest features. Be sure to have automated integration tests to help build your confidence when upgrading versions of PHP.

## CLI
Our [CLI variation](https://hub.docker.com/r/serversideup/php/tags?page=1&name=cli) has the components of PHP Command Line Interface only.

Great to use for:
* Installing composer packages locally
* You need a lightweight PHP CLI instance for a quick job

## FPM
Our [FPM variation](https://hub.docker.com/r/serversideup/php/tags?page=1&name=fpm) has the components of PHP FastCGI Process Manager (FPM) only.
