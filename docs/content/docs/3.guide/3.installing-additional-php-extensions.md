# How to install additional PHP extensions
We provide a number of PHP packages by default, but there will be times where you'll need to add additional PHP extensions in order to support a certain PHP library in your application. By default, we've included a popular tool called [`install-php-extensions`](https://github.com/mlocati/docker-php-extension-installer) that allows you to install almost any PHP module that you'll need. 

Installing extensions is easy. All you need to do is find the extension you'd like to install on the [docker-php-extension installer README](https://github.com/mlocati/docker-php-extension-installer#supported-php-extensions). Once you have the name of the extensions, you'll need to add it to the `Dockerfile` in your project.

label: "Example: Installing the \"intl\" extension"
---
```Dockerfile
FROM serversideup/php:8.2.12-fpm-nginx-bookworm

RUN install-php-extensions intl
```
::

It's really that simple. The `install-php-extensions` tool will automatically install the operating system packages that are required for the PHP extension to work and add the extension to PHP.

For more details on this script, we encourage you to check out the GitHub repository for this project.

## Common PHP extensions that you might need
We compiled a list of extensions for you to reference.

### intl
[intl](https://www.php.net/manual/en/intro.intl.php) is a PHP module that provides internationalization functions. You may want to install this module if you're using Laravel, specifically if you are validating emails with "DNS" or "spoof" validation.

Our tests showed this module will add about 40 MB of space to the Docker image, so we decided to not include it by default.
