# Adding your own start up scripts
::lead-p
We provide a few [default scripts](/docs/getting-started/default-configurations#default-entrypoint-scripts) to get you going, but sometimes you want to just add your own. We've made it easy to do that with our `entrypoint.d` directory.

## Entrypoint Script Requirements
Before you write your entry point script, be aware of the following requirements:

Your script should:
- Be executable (755 permissions)
- Located in the `/etc/entrypoint.d` directory
- Have the file extension ending in `.sh`

We also recommend writing your script in `/bin/sh` for the best compatibility between Alpine and Debian.

If you choose to use `/bin/bash`, your script will only be able to run on Debian-based images.
