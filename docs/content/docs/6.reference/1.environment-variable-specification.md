# Environment Variable Specifications
We like to customize our images on a per app basis using environment variables. Look below to see what variables are available and what their defaults are. You can easily override them in your own docker environments ([see Docker's documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/environment-variables/#set-environment-variables-in-containers)).

COMPOSER\_MAX\_PARALLEL\_HTTP|Set to an integer to configure how many files can be downloaded in parallel. This defaults to 12 and must be between 1 and 50.

S6\_VERBOSITY|Set the verbosity of "S6 Overlay" (the init system these images are based on). The default is "1" (print warnings and errors). The scale goes from 1 to 5, but the output will quickly become very noisy. If you're having issues, start here. You can also customize many other variables. (<a href="https://github.com/just-containers/s6-overlay#customizing-s6-behaviour">Official docs</a>)|all|"1"
