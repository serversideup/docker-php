## You're Not Alone

Getting stuck is a normal part of development. Whether you're troubleshooting a configuration issue, planning a complex deployment, or need help with a custom implementation, there are support options available to help you succeed.

This guide will help you find the right resource to get unblocked quickly.

## Free Community Support
::note
Want guaranteed response times from the maintainers? View our [Professional Support](#professional-support) options.
::
Our community is active, helpful, and welcoming. Most questions can be answered through these free resources:

### GitHub Discussions

**Best for:** General questions, feature requests, and community discussions

Our GitHub Discussions is the most popular place to get help from both the maintainers and the community. It's searchable, so your question might help others in the future.

::tip
Before posting, search existing discussions - your question might already be answered!

### Discord Community

**Best for:** Quick questions, real-time chat, and community interaction

Join over 3,000+ developers in our Discord server. It's a great place for quick questions, real-time troubleshooting, and connecting with other developers using serversideup/php.

::note
Discord is great for quick questions, but GitHub Discussions is better for complex issues that need detailed troubleshooting or permanent documentation.

### GitHub Issues

**Best for:** Bug reports and specific technical issues with the images

Found a bug or experiencing unexpected behavior? Open a GitHub issue with detailed reproduction steps.

:u-button{to="https://github.com/serversideup/docker-php/issues/new" label="Report an Issue" aria-label="Report an Issue" size="md" color="primary" variant="outline" trailing-icon="i-lucide-bug" class="font-bold" target="_blank"}

**When to use GitHub Issues:**
- The Docker images aren't behaving as documented
- You've found a security vulnerability
- You have a specific, reproducible bug

::warning
Please don't use GitHub Issues for general questions or support requests. Use GitHub Discussions or Discord instead.
