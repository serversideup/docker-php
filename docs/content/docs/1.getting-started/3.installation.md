`serversideup/php` is compatible with any container orchestrator that supports Docker images (Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, Docker Compose, HashiCorp Nomad, etc.). All images are hosted on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/serversideup/php) and [GitHub Packages](https://github.com/serversideup/docker-php/pkgs/container/php)  for free. Containers default to running Debian, but Alpine images are also available.

## Quick Start
::tip{to="/docs/getting-started/container-basics"}
New to containers? Check out our [Container Basics guide](/docs/getting-started/container-basics) for a beginner-friendly introduction to Docker and containerization.
::

In order to run containers, we need a container engine installed such as Docker. You can follow [Docker's installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/) to get started. Confirm Docker is working by running these commands in your terminal:
```bash [Terminal]
# Check Docker version
docker --version

# Check Docker Compose version
docker compose version
```

If you see version numbers after running the commands, you're ready to go!

### Create a new sample project
Let's create a new sample project to test our Docker setup. Open up your terminal and run the following commands:

```bash [Terminal]
# Create a project directory with a public directory
mkdir -p my-php-project/public

# Change directory to our project
cd my-php-project
```

Once we're in our project directory, we will want to create two files:

1. `public/index.php` - The file that will be served when someone visits our site
1. `compose.yml` - The place where we will put our configuration files

The content of these files should look like:

::code-tree{defaultValue="public/index.php"}

```yml [compose.yml]
services:
  php:
    # Choose our PHP version and variation
    image: serversideup/php:8.3-fpm-nginx
    # Expose localhost:80 to NGINX's port 8080
    ports:
      - 80:8080
    # Mount current directory to /var/www/html
    volumes:
      - ./:/var/www/html
    # PHP settings that we can override
    environment:
      PHP_UPLOAD_MAX_FILE_SIZE: "250M"
      PHP_OPCACHE_ENABLE: "0"
```

```php [public/index.php]
<?php
// Let's just print out some PHP info
phpinfo();
?>
```
::

Save these files and ensure they are in the exact structure above.

### Bringing up your PHP app
From your project root directory, run the following command to start your PHP app:

::warning
Make sure you are running the following commands from your **project root directory** (`my-php-project`). If you do not have `compose.yml` in the same directory as you run this command, the command will not work. Also, make sure you don't have any other containers or services that are currently running on port 80. If you do, you will need to stop them before running the following command.
::

::steps{level="4"}

#### Start the PHP container
```bash [Terminal]
docker compose up
```
You'll see the logs appear in your terminal. **Keep your terminal open** as we'll need it to control the container.

#### Viewing your PHP app
To view your PHP app, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost`. You should see the PHP info page showing PHP `8.3` with the `fpm-nginx` variation:

![PHP Info Page](images/docs/php-info.png)

You can see the PHP version is in the upper left corner of the page. But what's also cool is you can see the settings we configured in the `compose.yml` file are being applied.

Look for these values in the PHP info page:

- `upload_max_filesize` - This should show `250M`
- `opcache.enable` - This should show `Off`

::

### Making changes
::caution
To have our changes take effect, we must restart the containers.
::

Let's make some upgrades to our PHP app:

1. Let's upgrade to PHP 8.4
1. Let's use FrankenPHP instead of FPM-NGINX
2. Turn on OPCache
3. Increase the upload limit to 500M

To do this, we need to need to:

::steps{level="4"}

#### Stop the container
**Press :kbd{value="ctrl"} + :kbd{value="C"} on the original terminal window** or you can run the following command *in a new terminal window from your project root directory*:
```bash [Terminal]
docker compose down
```

#### Making changes to your PHP app
Make the updates below to your `compose.yml` file:

```yml [compose.yml]{3-4,10-13}
services:
  php:
    # Change image to 8.4 with FrankenPHP
    image: serversideup/php:8.4-frankenphp
    ports:
      - 80:8080
    volumes:
      - ./:/var/www/html
    environment:
      # Increase the upload limit to 500M
      PHP_UPLOAD_MAX_FILE_SIZE: "500M"
      # Turn OPCache on
      PHP_OPCACHE_ENABLE: "1"
```

#### Bring the container up again
```bash [Terminal]
docker compose up
```
You'll see the logs appear in your terminal. **Keep your terminal open** as we'll need it to control the container.

#### Refresh your browser

Check `http://localhost` again and you should see the changes we made:

Holy smokes! We've upgraded to PHP 8.4 and you're using FrankenPHP! You can also find the changes to the PHP settings have been applied.

## You've got this 💪
You've successfully created your first PHP app with Docker. Better yet, you've seen the power of serversideup/php where it's easy to change your PHP version and variation by changing a single line in your configuration file.

If you're curious what the whole process looks like from Development to Production, check out out guide below.
