## The Problem with Traditional PHP Deployment

If you've ever deployed a PHP application to production, you've probably experienced one (or all) of these frustrations:

- **"It works on my machine"** - Your local environment doesn't match production, leading to mysterious bugs that only appear after deployment
- **Configuration Hell** - Spending hours tweaking `php.ini`, `www.conf`, and web server configs across multiple servers
- **Security Vulnerabilities** - Running as root, outdated extensions, or misconfigured permissions exposing your application to attacks
- **Manual Server Management** - SSH-ing into servers to update PHP, install extensions, or troubleshoot issues
- **Inconsistent Environments** - Each server is slightly different, making debugging and scaling a nightmare
- **Framework-Specific Tweaks** - Researching and applying dozens of optimizations for Laravel or WordPress performance

You're not alone. These are the exact problems that led us to create `serversideup/php`.

## How serversideup/php Solves These Problems

`serversideup/php` is built on the official PHP images but adds everything needed for real-world production use:

- ✅ **Works Identically Everywhere** - Same container runs on your laptop, CI/CD, and production
- ✅ **Zero Configuration Required** - Production-ready defaults with simple environment variable customization
- ✅ **Secure by Default** - Runs as unprivileged user, hardened for the open internet
- ✅ **Batteries Included** - Composer, common extensions, and helpful utilities pre-installed
- ✅ **Framework Optimized** - Pre-configured for Laravel and WordPress best practices
- ✅ **Modern Architecture** - FrankenPHP, S6 Overlay, native health checks, and multi-process support

::note
**Trusted by the Community** - Over 1 million Docker image pulls and actively used by Laravel and PHP developers worldwide.

## Key Advantages Explained

### Security First: Unprivileged by Default

::caution
Running containers as `root` in production is a critical security vulnerability. If your application is compromised, an attacker gains root access to your container which could lead to a full system compromise.
::

Our images run as the `www-data` user by default, following the principle of least privilege. This means:

- **Limited Blast Radius** - If your application is compromised, don't have root privileges
- **Kubernetes Compatible** - Many Kubernetes clusters require non-root containers by policy
- **Production Best Practice** - Aligns with NIST and CIS security benchmarks

We also include additional security hardening:
- Disabled dangerous PHP functions by default (but you control them)
- Proper file permissions out of the box
- CloudFlare trusted proxy support for accurate IP logging
- Regular security updates from official PHP base images

### Performance Optimized

Every image includes production-tuned defaults based on real-world PHP applications:

**OPcache Configuration**
- Pre-configured for optimal memory usage and caching strategy
- Easily toggle between development and production modes
- Smart defaults that work for most applications

**Process Management**
- PHP-FPM tuned for typical low resource usage for Laravel/WordPress workloads
- S6 Overlay for intelligent process supervision
- Graceful shutdown handling for zero-downtime deployments

**Modern Options**
- FrankenPHP support for incredible performance gains (2-3x faster than FPM in many claims made by developers)
- Native support for NGINX Unit
- HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 ready configurations

::tip
Need to customize performance settings? Just set an environment variable like `PHP_OPCACHE_ENABLE=1` or `PHP_MEMORY_LIMIT=512M`. No config files needed.
::

### Developer Experience: Variable-First Configuration

Stop editing config files. Stop rebuilding images for simple changes. Just set environment variables:

```yml [compose.yml] {5-9,11-12}
services:
  php:
    image: serversideup/php:8.4-fpm-nginx
    environment:
      # Change any PHP setting with environment variables
      PHP_MEMORY_LIMIT: "512M"
      PHP_UPLOAD_MAX_FILE_SIZE: "100M"
      PHP_MAX_EXECUTION_TIME: "180"
      PHP_OPCACHE_ENABLE: "1"
      
      # Run Migrations, Storage Link, Caching, and more
      AUTORUN_ENABLED: "true"
```

No Dockerfile modifications. No config file mounting. No image rebuilds. Just simple environment variables with production-ready defaults.

### Framework Optimized for Laravel & WordPress

We've done the hard work of optimizing for PHP's most popular frameworks:

**Laravel Automations**
```yaml [compose.yml]
services:
  php:
    image: serversideup/php:8.3-fpm-nginx
    environment:
      # Run migrations, storage link, caching, and more
      AUTORUN_ENABLED: "true"
```

:u-button{to="/docs/framework-guides/laravel/automations" label="Learn More About Laravel Automations" aria-label="Learn More About Laravel Automations" size="md" color="primary" variant="outline" trailing-icon="i-lucide-arrow-right" class="font-bold"}

**WordPress Optimizations**
- Pre-installed PHP extensions WordPress needs
- Optimized PHP settings for WordPress performance
- Support for popular WordPress hosting patterns

**All Frameworks Welcome**

While we optimize for Laravel and WordPress, our images work great with:
- Symfony
- CodeIgniter
- Drupal
- Joomla
- Custom PHP applications

### Batteries Included

Unlike the official PHP images, we include tools you'll actually use:

**Composer**
- Pre-installed and ready to use
- No need to install it in every Dockerfile
- Supports Composer v2 for lightning-fast installs

**install-php-extensions**
- The popular [mlocati/docker-php-extension-installer](https://github.com/mlocati/docker-php-extension-installer) included
- Install any PHP extension with a single command
- Handles all dependencies automatically

```dockerfile [Dockerfile]
FROM serversideup/php:8.4-cli

# Switch to root to install extensions
USER root

# Install any PHP extension easily
RUN install-php-extensions redis imagick mongodb

# Switch back to unprivileged user
USER www-data
```

**Modern Init System**
- S6 Overlay for our FPM-Apache and FPM-NGINX variations
- Proper process supervision in containers
- Better than Supervisor for containerized workloads
- Graceful handling of signals for zero-downtime deployments

**Multiple Variations**
Choose the right tool for your use case:
- [`cli`](/docs/image-variations/cli) - Command-line scripts, Composer, CI/CD
- [`fpm`](/docs/image-variations/fpm) - Just PHP-FPM (bring your own web server)
- [`fpm-nginx`](/docs/image-variations/fpm-nginx) - PHP-FPM + NGINX (most popular)
- [`fpm-apache`](/docs/image-variations/fpm-apache) - PHP-FPM + Apache
- [`frankenphp`](/docs/image-variations/frankenphp) - Modern, incredibly fast (2-3x FPM performance)
- [`unit`](/docs/image-variations/unit) - NGINX Unit for high-performance applications (deprecated)

## Making the Switch

### From Traditional Servers (LAMP/LEMP)

If you're currently managing PHP on traditional servers, the switch to containers might seem daunting, but it's easier than you think:

**Benefits You'll Gain**
- Identical environments from development to production
- Scale horizontally by adding more containers
- Roll back bad deployments in seconds
- Version control your entire infrastructure

See our quick start guide to run your first PHP container.

### From Official PHP Images

Already using Docker with official PHP images? Switching is trivially easy.

:u-button{to="/docs/guide/migrating-from-official-php-images" label="Official PHP Migration Guide" aria-label="Official PHP Migration Guide" size="md" color="primary" variant="outline" trailing-icon="i-lucide-arrow-right" class="font-bold"}

### From Other Docker Images

Switching from Bitnami, custom images, or other PHP Docker images is straightforward:

**Key Differences to Note**
- We run as `www-data` (UID 33) by default, not root
- Configuration via environment variables, not config file mounts
- Web root is `/var/www/html` by default
- All variations expose port `8080` (unprivileged port)

**Migration Strategy**
1. Review our [environment variable specification](/docs/reference/environment-variable-specification)
2. Map your current config to environment variables
3. Test in development first
4. Switch image tag in production

::warning
Always test in a development or staging environment first to ensure your application works correctly with the new image.
