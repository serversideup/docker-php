title: Migrating from official PHP images
---

::lead-p
Migrating from the official PHP images to serversideup/php is easy because our images are based on the official PHP images. We just give you a "batteries included" experience that's ready for production.
::

## Key differences
::warning
Because our images run as `www-data` by default, you may need to update file permissions for mounted volumes.

::steps{level="4"}

#### Figure out which image you'd like to use
Review our [choosing an image](/docs/getting-started/choosing-an-image) guide to help you decide which image you'd like to use. Also, make sure our [default configurations](/docs/getting-started/default-configurations) satisfy your requirements.

#### Update your `Dockerfile` or `compose.yml` file
:::tip
We simply change `php:8.5-apache` to `serversideup/php:8.5-fpm-apache`
:::
**Dockerfile**
:::code-group
```dockerfile [ORIGINAL: Dockerfile]{1}
FROM php:8.5-apache

# Rest of your Dockerfile...
```
```dockerfile [UPDATED: Dockerfile]{1}
FROM serversideup/php:8.5-fpm-apache

# Rest of your Dockerfile...
```
:::

**compose.yml**
:::code-group
```yml [ORIGINAL: compose.yml]{3,5-6}
services:
  php:
    image: php:8.5-apache
    ports:
      - 80:80
      - 443:443
```
```yml [UPDATED: compose.yml]{3,5-6}
services:
  php:
    image: serversideup/php:8.5-fpm-apache
    ports:
      - 80:8080
      - 443:8443
```
