## Laravel Queue with Docker
Run Laravel queue workers by passing the Artisan queue command as the container's command. This allows you to scale queue workers independently from your web server.

## Docker Compose example

::tip{to="https://getspin.pro/docs/services/laravel-scheduler" target="_blank"}
Want to skip the setup? [Spin Pro](https://getspin.pro/docs/services/laravel-scheduler){target="_blank"} handles Laravel queue workers on your VPS with Docker and zero-downtime deployments—all configured for you.
::

This example runs a dedicated queue container using the same image as your web service. Use the full path to Artisan (`/var/www/html/artisan`) when defining the container command.
```yml [compose.yml]
services:
  php:
    image: my/laravel-app

  queue:
    image: my/laravel-app
    command: ["php", "/var/www/html/artisan", "queue:work", "--tries=3"]
    stop_signal: SIGTERM
    healthcheck:
      # This is our native healthcheck script for the queue
      test: ["CMD", "healthcheck-queue"]
      start_period: 10s
```

## Advanced configuration

**Graceful shutdown:** The `SIGTERM` signal ensures queue workers finish processing current jobs before stopping. This is especially important for `fpm-apache` and `fpm-nginx` images.

**Multiple processes in one container:** Need to run queues alongside your web server? Use [S6 Overlay scripts](/docs/guide/using-s6-overlay#customizing-the-initialization-process) to manage multiple processes in a single container.
