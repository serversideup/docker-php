## Laravel Task Scheduler with Docker
Run Laravel's task scheduler by using the `schedule:work` command. This runs the scheduler in the foreground and checks for scheduled tasks every minute—perfect for containers.

## Why not use cron?

::note
Unlike traditional server setups, we don't use `cron` in containers. Instead, Laravel's [schedule:work](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/scheduling#running-the-scheduler-locally){target="_blank"} command keeps the process running in the foreground and checks for tasks every minute. You define the actual schedule (daily, hourly, etc.) in your Laravel application using [scheduled tasks](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/scheduling#scheduling-artisan-commands){target="_blank"}.

## Docker Compose example

This example runs a dedicated scheduler container using the same image as your web service. Use the full path to Artisan (`/var/www/html/artisan`) when defining the container command.

**Key points:**
- Use the same image for both your web and scheduler services
- Set `SIGTERM` as the stop signal for graceful shutdown (especially for `fpm-apache` and `fpm-nginx`)
- Include a health check to monitor scheduler status
- Define your actual schedule times in Laravel, not in Docker

```yml [compose.yml]
services:
  php:
    image: my/laravel-app

  task:
    image: my/laravel-app
    command: ["php", "/var/www/html/artisan", "schedule:work"]
    stop_signal: SIGTERM
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "healthcheck-schedule"]
      start_period: 10s
```

## Defining your schedule in Laravel

Configure your scheduled tasks in Laravel. The file location depends on your Laravel version:

::tabs

:::tabs-item{label="Laravel 11+"}


```php [routes/console.php]
<?php
 
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Schedule;
 
Schedule::command('app:process-invoices')
    ->daily() // Run this task once per day
    ->at('02:00') // At 2:00 AM
    ->timezone('America/Chicago'); // In the Chicago timezone
    
Schedule::command('app:process-latefees')
    ->daily() // Run this task once per day
    ->at('04:00') // At 4:00 AM
    ->timezone('America/Chicago'); // In the Chicago timezone
```

:::

:::tabs-item{label="Laravel 10 and below" }

```php [app/Console/Kernel.php]
<?php

namespace App\Console;

use Illuminate\Console\Scheduling\Schedule;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Console\Kernel as ConsoleKernel;

class Kernel extends ConsoleKernel
{
    /**
     * The Artisan commands provided by your application.
     *
     * @var array
     */
    protected $commands = [
        //
    ];

    /**
     * Define the application's command schedule.
     *
     * @param  \Illuminate\Console\Scheduling\Schedule  $schedule
     * @return void
     */
    protected function schedule(Schedule $schedule)
    {
        $schedule->command('process:invoices')->daily()->at('02:00')->timezone('America/Chicago');
        $schedule->command('process:latefees')->daily()->at('04:00')->timezone('America/Chicago');
    }

    /**
     * Register the commands for the application.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    protected function commands()
    {
        $this->load(__DIR__.'/Commands');

        require base_path('routes/console.php');
    }
}
```

::tip
**Multiple processes in one container:** If you're running `fpm-nginx` or `fpm-apache` and you'd like to have everything in a single container, you can [write your own S6 Overlay service script](https://github.com/just-containers/s6-overlay/tree/master#writing-a-service-script){target="_blank"} to properly manage multiple processes in a single container. Learn more about about this in our [Using S6 Overlay guide](/docs/guide/using-s6-overlay).
