## Laravel Reverb with Docker
Run Laravel Reverb by passing the Artisan command as the container's command. Reverb is Laravel's WebSocket server for real-time communication.

::tip{to="https://getspin.pro/docs/services/laravel-scheduler" target="_blank"}
Want to skip the setup? [Spin Pro](https://getspin.pro/docs/services/laravel-scheduler){target="_blank"} handles Laravel Reverb on your VPS with Docker and zero-downtime deployments—all configured for you.
::

::note
Before using Reverb with Docker, follow the [Laravel Reverb setup instructions](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/reverb) to install and configure the Reverb package in your Laravel application.
::

## Docker Compose example

This example runs Reverb as a separate container using the same image as your web service. Reverb requires a reverse proxy (like Traefik) to route WebSocket traffic correctly.

**Key points:**
- Use the same image for both your web and Reverb services
- Reverb runs on a different port than your web server (8000 vs 8080)
- Set `SIGTERM` as the stop signal for graceful shutdown (especially for `fpm-apache` and `fpm-nginx`)
- Include a health check to monitor Reverb status
- Configure a reverse proxy to route traffic to the correct container
```yml [compose.yml]
services:
  php:
    image: my/laravel-app
    labels:
      - "traefik.enable=true"
      - "traefik.http.routers.laravel.tls=true"
      - "traefik.http.routers.laravel.entrypoints=websecure"
      - "traefik.http.routers.laravel.rule=Host(`https://app.example.com`)"
      - "traefik.http.services.laravel.loadbalancer.server.port=8080"
      - "traefik.http.services.laravel.loadbalancer.server.scheme=http"

  reverb:
    image: my/laravel-app
    command: ["php", "/var/www/html/artisan", "reverb:start", "--port=8000"]
    stop_signal: SIGTERM
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "healthcheck-reverb"]
      start_period: 10s
    labels:
      - "traefik.enable=true"
      - "traefik.http.routers.reverb.tls=true"
      - "traefik.http.routers.reverb.entrypoints=websecure"
      - "traefik.http.routers.reverb.rule=Host(`https://reverb.example.com`)"
      - "traefik.http.services.reverb.loadbalancer.server.port=8000"
      - "traefik.http.services.reverb.loadbalancer.server.scheme=http"
```

## Environment variable configuration

::warning
Don't confuse **CLIENT** variables with **SERVER** variables. The `REVERB_SERVER_*` variables configure the Reverb daemon itself, while `REVERB_*` variables tell your frontend clients how to connect.
::

Configure these environment variables in your Laravel application:

| **Laravel ENV Variable** | **Description** | **Value (matching example above)** |
| ------------------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `REVERB_HOST`             | The hostname the **CLIENT** will connect to | `reverb.example.com` |
| `REVERB_PORT`             | The port the **CLIENT** will connect to | `443` |
| `REVERB_SCHEME`           | The scheme the **CLIENT** will connect to | `https` |

## Advanced configuration

::tip
**Multiple processes in one container:** If you're running `fpm-nginx` or `fpm-apache` and you'd like to have everything in a single container, you can [write your own S6 Overlay service script](https://github.com/just-containers/s6-overlay/tree/master#writing-a-service-script){target="_blank"} to properly manage multiple processes in a single container. Learn more about about this in our [Using S6 Overlay guide](/docs/guide/using-s6-overlay).
