## Laravel Horizon with Docker
Run Laravel Horizon by passing the Artisan command as the container's command. Horizon provides a dashboard and monitoring for your Redis queues.

## Docker Compose example

Want to skip the setup? [Spin Pro](https://getspin.pro/docs/services/laravel-scheduler){target="_blank"} handles Laravel Horizon on your VPS with Docker and zero-downtime deployments—all configured for you.

This example runs a dedicated Horizon container using the same image as your web service. Horizon requires Redis to be running and properly configured in your `.env` file.

**Key points:**
- Use the same image for both your web and Horizon services
- Ensure Redis is running before starting Horizon
- Configure Redis connection details in your `.env` file
- Set `SIGTERM` as the stop signal for graceful shutdown (especially for `fpm-apache` and `fpm-nginx`)
- Include a health check to monitor Horizon status

```yml [compose.yml]
services:
  php:
    image: my/laravel-app

  redis:
    image: redis:6
    command: "redis-server --appendonly yes --requirepass redispassword"

  horizon:
    image: my/laravel-app
    command: ["php", "/var/www/html/artisan", "horizon"]
    stop_signal: SIGTERM
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "healthcheck-horizon"]
      start_period: 10s
```

## Advanced configuration

**Graceful shutdown:** The `SIGTERM` signal ensures Horizon finishes processing current jobs before stopping. This is especially important for `fpm-apache` and `fpm-nginx` images.

**Multiple processes in one container:** Need to run Horizon alongside your web server? Use [S6 Overlay scripts](/docs/guide/using-s6-overlay#customizing-the-initialization-process) to manage multiple processes in a single container.
