## Laravel Nightwatch with Docker
Run Laravel Nightwatch by passing the Artisan command as the container's command. Nightwatch is Laravel's observability platform for monitoring application performance, errors, and queries in real-time.

::note
Before using Nightwatch with Docker, follow the [Laravel Nightwatch setup instructions](https://nightwatch.laravel.com/docs/start-guide) to install and configure the Nightwatch package in your Laravel application.

## Docker Compose example

This example runs Nightwatch as a separate container using the same image as your web service.

**Key points:**
- Use the same image for both your web and Nightwatch services
- Set `SIGTERM` as the stop signal for graceful shutdown (especially for `fpm-apache` and `fpm-nginx`)
- Include a health check to monitor Nightwatch status

```yml [compose.yml]
services:
  php:
    image: my/laravel-app

  nightwatch:
    image: my/laravel-app
    command: ["php", "/var/www/html/artisan", "nightwatch:agent"]
    stop_signal: SIGTERM
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "healthcheck-nightwatch"]
      start_period: 10s
```

## How the health check works

The `healthcheck-nightwatch` command runs `php artisan nightwatch:status` to verify that the Nightwatch agent is running and connected. Docker uses this to determine container health and can automatically restart unhealthy containers.

## Advanced configuration

**Graceful shutdown:** The `SIGTERM` signal ensures the Nightwatch agent finishes processing current events before stopping. This is especially important for `fpm-apache` and `fpm-nginx` images.

::tip
**Multiple processes in one container:** If you're running `fpm-nginx` or `fpm-apache` and you'd like to have everything in a single container, you can [write your own S6 Overlay service script](https://github.com/just-containers/s6-overlay/tree/master#writing-a-service-script){target="_blank"} to properly manage multiple processes in a single container. Learn more about about this in our [Using S6 Overlay guide](/docs/guide/using-s6-overlay).
