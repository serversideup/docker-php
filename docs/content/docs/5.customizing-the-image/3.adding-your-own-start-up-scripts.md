# Adding your own start up scripts
::lead-p
We provide a few [default scripts](/docs/getting-started/default-configurations#default-entrypoint-scripts) to get you going, but sometimes you want to just add your own. We've made it easy to do that with our `entrypoint.d` directory.
::

## Entrypoint Script Requirements
::note
Before you write your entry point script, be aware of the following requirements:

Your script should:
- Be executable (755 permissions)
- Located in the `/etc/entrypoint.d` directory
- Have the file extension ending in `.sh`
::
We recommend writing your script in `/bin/sh` for the best compatibility between Alpine and Debian. If you choose to use `/bin/bash`, your script will only be able to run on Debian-based images.

## Choose your execution order
Since [we provide default entrypoint scripts](/docs/getting-started/default-configurations#default-entrypoint-scripts), you may want to choose the order in which your scripts are executed. We've made it easy to do that by prefixing your script with a number. The lower the number, the earlier it will be executed.

::note
If you want to disable our entrypoint scripts, you can set `DISABLE_DEFAULT_CONFIG` to `true` in your environment variables.
::

## Example: Create a custom entrypoint script
In this example, let's create a `99-my-script.sh` so it executes after all the other default scripts.

First, let's take a look at our project structure:

::code-panel
---
label: "Project Structure"
---
```txt
.
â”œâ”€â”€ Dockerfile
â”œâ”€â”€ docker-compose.yml
â”œâ”€â”€ entrypoint.d
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ 99-my-script.sh
â””â”€â”€ public
    â””â”€â”€ index.php
```
::
Let's take a look at the script that we want to run. We can keep this simple for now.

::code-panel
---
label: "99-my-script.sh"
---
```bash
#!/bin/sh
echo "ðŸ‘‹ Hello, world!"
```
::

Now, let's take a look at our `Dockerfile`:

::code-panel
---
label: "Dockerfile"
---
```dockerfile
FROM serversideup/php:8.3-unit

COPY --chmod=755 ./entrypoint.d/ /etc/entrypoint.d/
```
::

In the above file, we're copying our `entrypoint.d` directory to `/etc/entrypoint.d/` in the container. We're also setting the permissions to `755` so our scripts are executable.

Finally, let's take a look at our `docker-compose.yml` file:

::code-panel
---
label: "docker-compose.yml"
---
```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  php:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
      - 80:8080
    volumes:
      - .:/var/www/html
```
::

In the above file, we're building our image using the `Dockerfile` in the current directory. We're also mounting our current directory to `/var/www/html` in the container.

## Running our example
When we run `docker compose up`, we should see the following output:

::code-panel
---
label: "Output of \"docker compose up\""
---
```txt

```
::

You can see our `ðŸ‘‹ Hello, world!` is executing *after* the initialization of `10-init-unit.sh`.
